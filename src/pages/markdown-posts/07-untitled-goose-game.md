Geese are fucking assholes. They’re aggressive birds with a horrifying mouth that contains sharp, bristled tongues resembling shark teeth. Incredibly territorial, if you take one step towards their nest they will not hesitate to attack, even if you’re just walking on a path. Feeding them is an even worse idea, since they’ll lose their fear of humans and become little urban terrorists, which is exactly what you are in *Untitled Goose Game*.

This game is all about stealth and puzzle solving as you waddle from one town space to the next wreaking havoc and crossing off tasks on your to-do list. You can grab various items with your beak, honk at people, flap your wings, and lower your head to approach problems and gain access to the next area. It’s such a stupid concept done well.

The art direction of cel-shaded environments to create crisp renditions of the goose and characters adds to the light-hearted, comedic nature of the game. Stealing people’s personal belongings, untying their shoes to make them trip, or trapping them inside a garage are genuinely fun to watch play out because of the absurdity that comes with piloting a goose. 

The controls can get a little finnicky at parts, or you may get frustrated cause the dick of a bouncer at the pub stole your pint glass again and won’t give it back, but due to its concise length any imprecision in gameplay is a minor issue. The novelty of the game also doesn’t over stay its welcome, with the whole game clocking in around 5-6 hours and the initial campaign coming in around 2.5-3 hours. The short length and $20 price point are going to cause some pause in people, but if you’re a fan of unique indie titles this one scratches the itch.

I give *Mission Impossible: Asshole Goose Simulator* a solid 5 out of 7. Honk Honk motherfucker.
